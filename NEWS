** Installation changes

  The installation process has changed. Please read INSTALL.

** Dependency changes

   ImageMagick is not longer used.

   libpng is now required.

   GCC is not required, any compiler for ISO C 99 will do.

   The GNU C library, or any POSIX-compliant C standard
   library with the getopt_long function, is now required.

** Improvements

  The option --raw has been added. This option makes scrotty
  store the images as a portable anymap format image rather
  than as Portable Network Graphics image.

  The ability to pass arguments to convert(1) has been
  removed. Utilise the --exec option instead!

  The Texinfo manual lists the basics of strftime(3P).

  have been added.

  Performance is significantly improved (for PNG images)
  because images are stored directly as PNG and not converted.

  added as an optional features.

** Translations

  The program and the man page has been translated to Swedish.

** Bug fixes

  The images is not saved as PNM if PNG is requested but the

  the program selected filename automatically and needed to
  add a number at the end so that existing files were not
  overriden.
