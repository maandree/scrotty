NAME
	scrotty 1.1-dev - Framebuffer screenshot program

SYNOPSIS
	scrotty [OPTION]... [FILENAME_PATTERN] [-- CONVERT_OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
	scrotty is a minimalist screenshoter for your framebuffers.
	It takes a screenshot of your TTY session. X is not supported.

	scrotty is designed after scrot(1), but includes a some
	improvements. Namely it does not support delaying the screenshot,
	selecting image quality or creating thumbnails, but it has
	support for adding arbitrary arguments to convert(1), which is
	used to save the image.

OPTIONS
	--help
		Print usage information.

	--version
		Print program name and version.

	--copyright
		Print copyright information.

	--raw
		Save in PNM rather than in PNG.

	--exec CMD
		Command to run for each saved image.

SPECIAL STRINGS
	Both the --exec and FILENAME_PATTERN parameters can take format
	specifiers that are expanded by scrotty when encountered. There
	are two types of format specifier. Characters preceded by a '%'
	are interpreted by strftime(3). These options may be used to
	refer to the current date and time. The second kind are internal
	to scrotty and are prefixed by '$' or '\'. The following specifiers
	are recognised:
	
	$i	framebuffer index
	$f	image filename/pathname (ignored in FILENAME_PATTERN)
	$n	image filename          (ignored in FILENAME_PATTERN)
	$p	image width multiplied by image height
	$w	image width
	$h	image height
	$$	expands to a literal '$'
	\n	expands to a new line
	\\	expands to a literal '\'
	\ 	expands to a literal ' ' (backslash, space)

	A space that is not prefixed by a backslash in --exec is
	interpreted as an argument delimiter. This is the case even at
	the beginning and end of the string and if a space was the
	previous character in the string.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
	Support for TTY:s in other kernels should be added.

RATIONALE
	Taking screenshots was a pain before this. Screenshots
	are useful if you want to remember something or send an
	image of how something looks.
