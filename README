NAME
	scrotty 2.0-dev - Framebuffer screenshot program

SYNOPSIS
	scrotty [OPTION]... [--] [FILENAME_PATTERN | > FILE]

DESCRIPTION
	scrotty is a minimalist screenshoter for your framebuffers.
	It takes a screenshot of your TTY session. X is not supported.

	scrotty is designed after scrot(1), but includes a some
	improvements. Namely it does not support delaying the screenshot,
	selecting image quality or creating thumbnails. That is left
	to be done by the user with the option --exec and a a utility
	such as convert(1).

OPTIONS
	-h, --help
		Print usage information.

	-v, --version
		Print program name and version.

	-c, --copyright
		Print copyright information.

	-d, --device NO
		Select framebuffer device.

	-e, --exec CMD
		Command to run for each saved image.

	Each option can only be used once.

SPECIAL STRINGS
	Both the --exec and FILENAME_PATTERN parameters can take format
	specifiers that are expanded by scrotty when encountered. There
	are two types of format specifier. Characters preceded by a '%'
	are interpreted by strftime(3). These options may be used to
	refer to the current date and time. The second kind are internal
	to scrotty and are prefixed by '$' or '\'. The following specifiers
	are recognised:
	
	$i	framebuffer index
	$f	image filename/pathname (ignored in FILENAME_PATTERN)
	$n	image filename          (ignored in FILENAME_PATTERN)
	$p	image width multiplied by image height
	$w	image width
	$h	image height
	$$	expands to a literal '$'
	\n	expands to a new line
	\\	expands to a literal '\'
	\ 	expands to a literal ' ' (backslash, space)

	A space that is not prefixed by a backslash in --exec is
	interpreted as an argument delimiter. This is the case even at
	the beginning and end of the string and if a space was the
	previous character in the string.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
	Support for TTY:s in other kernels should be added.

RATIONALE
	Taking screenshots was a pain before this (except, fbcat
	already existed without my knowledge.) Screenshots
	are useful if you want to remember something or send an
	image of how something looks.
